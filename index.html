            <p>My name is Javier Pagan, I was born on May 14, 1991 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I was raised in Puerto Rico but moved after finishing 5th grade to Kissimmee, Florida at the age of 16.
            I lived 6 years in Florida and moved a lot during those 6 years. My family decided to move back to Puerto Rico as I was starting my senior year in high school which I finished while doing home schooling.
            At this point, in 2009 I started working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.
            2 years in, I changed my major to Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting since I have always loved working with businesses and accounting is the language of business.
            I graduated from Accounting in 2015 and started working full time to gain experience. I moved to the Washington DC area in January 2018 and here I am learning to become a full stack developer. </p>
